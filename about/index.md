<h3>National Geographic, the U.S. Department of State (MapGive), the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, Missing Maps and OpenStreetMap US are hosting mapping events at colleges, universities and clubs to map food resources around the globe, following this year’s Geography Awareness Week theme, “The Future of Food.”</h3>
<p/><br/>
National Geographic will host the flagship OpenStreetMap mapping party on Friday, Nov. 21, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. EST at National Geographic headquarters in Washington, D.C., with the goal of putting food resources on the map. Admission is free, but interested individuals should <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/national-geographic-geography-awareness-week-mapping-party-tickets-13995325395">RSVP online</a>.
<p/>
On the local level, grassroots organizers around the world are holding <a href="/events/">over 25 events</a> (and counting) at local schools and community centers during OSMGeoWeek. If you are organizing an event, or even thinking about it, get in touch at osmgeoweek@gmail.com.
<p/>
The <a href="/plan/">Guides</a> are a collection of resources for planning and hosting a local event, and for participants at the event to learn and contribute to OSM. We are also launching the first beta of <a href="http://teachosm.org/">TeachOSM</a> this week, a resource for educators to bring OSM into the classroom.
<p/>
The <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> are a collection of remote and local tasks to work on during the week. Organizers and participants can choose projects that strike their interest, most all on the theme ,"Future of Food". As the week progresses, we'll add animations and stats to visualize progress.
